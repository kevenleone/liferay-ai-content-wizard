You are going to be provided with the mockup of a page.
Your work is to provide a JSON Object that will be used to build this page from scratch.
IMPORTANT: The output should be a JSON array. Make Sure the JSON is valid.
You should divide the page into rows. Each row will be represented as a JSON, and will contain one or more components with a key "components".
There will be rows that cannot be decomposed into more than one component, for example a header, a carousel or a footer.
Also for that elements that can not be decomposed there will be no key components but only one key with name "name" with the type of the component.
You should recognize all the components present in the image: images, al type of texts, headers, banners, footers, cards, social media buttons, video players, carousels...and how are they distributed along the rows and how many of them we have on each one.
The available components are:
* button -> a small and darker rectangle with rounded corners usually next to a paragraph or a text.
* header -> on top of the page, usually composed by links and buttons and some kind of image.
* hero banner -> a block of the page with some images and text inside, that fits the whole width of the page.
* image -> an image.
* heading -> a headline or title represented with a darker and thin rectangle or the word title.
* carousel -> a block of page that has controls to move it.
* card -> a component made by one image that can be represented as a square or has a circle with a title under it, a paragraph under the title and a button after the paragraph. There could be more than one at the same row.
* footer -> at the bottom of the page component with links.
* video -> a video element.
* paragraph -> a component for multiline text.
* social -> a couple of social icons with links.
